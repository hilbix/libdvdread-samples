Sample files from libdvdread-0.9.7
==================================

libdvdread-0.9.7-tar.gz contained some sources for sample binaries, which are good for shell usage.  Sadly, newer libs no more contain this.

This is a quick'n'dirty archive to bring them back.


Usage
-----

```
sudo apt-get install libdvdread-dev

git clone https://github.com/hilbix/libdvdread-samples
cd libdvdread-samples
make
sudo make install
```
